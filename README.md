# Laptop-Price-Prediction-System in python

Data Acquisition:
• This involves gathering data on laptops and their selling prices.
• Sources can include online retailers, manufacturer websites, or public datasets
scraped from the web.

Data Preprocessing:
The collected data needs cleaning and preparation for machine learning models.

This might involve:
• Handling missing values
• Formatting inconsistencies
• Removing outliers
• Transforming categorical data into numerical values

Feature Engineering:
• CPU specifications (brand, cores, clock speed)
• RAM size
• Storage capacity (HDD/SSD)
• Screen size and resolution
• Graphics card type

• Brand and model
Popular options include:
• Linear Regression
• Random Forest Regression.
• XGBoost Regression (powerful for high accuracy)
• Train the model on the prepared data. This involves feeding the data into the
algorithm and letting it learn the patterns between features and prices.

Model Evaluation:
Assess the performance of the trained model on a separate test dataset. This helps
ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Mean Squared Error:
Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual prices.

R-squared:
Represents the proportion of variance in the price data explained by the model.

Tools and libraries:
Laptop price prediction project we use pandas, matplotlib/seaborn, NumPy, scikit-learn,
scikit-learn.metrics, joblib, Jupyter Notebook/Spyder/PyCharm etc.
